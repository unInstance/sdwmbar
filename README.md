## Notes from me

Thanks [sakhmatd](https://sakhmatd.ee/) for starting this project that I am
glad to contribute to. This fork mainly exists for my contributions but there
is a single difference: I am not so eager to show off my dwm version, so I
dropped this function from the source code.

## SDWMBar

A simple statusbar for [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org).

Made to work with FreeBSD, may work on other BSD systems
(please tell me if it does, and I'll mention it).

Currently shows load averages, date-time and battery life.
